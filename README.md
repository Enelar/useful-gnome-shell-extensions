# Useful GNOME Shell Extensions

The [GNOME 3 Desktop](https://www.gnome.org/) is a user-friendly modern desktop environment that is ideal for novice Linux users as well as experienced Linux users.
However, the vanilla GNOME 3 Shell lacks some useful features for the daily use.

This is where the GNOME Shell extensions come into play.
They allow end users to customize their GNOME 3 Shell by installing a few
extensions from the GNOME website [extensions.gnome.org](http://extensions.gnome.org).

Since I always forget the names of my favourite extensions,
I decided to keep a list of these handy extensions.
This is why this GitHub repository was created.
The latter lists a few useful GNOME shell extensions that customize the vanilla GNOME 3 Shell into a more usable desktop environment. The screenshot above illustrates my customized GNOME 3 desktop
once I installed and configured some extensions.

So here is a list of my installed GNOME extensions:
